# INSTRUMENTATION AMPLIFIER

**AIM**: To design and analyze instrumentation amplifier using 741 IC Op-amp in LTSpice
simulator.

**Components required**: Î¼A741 IC (Op-Amp), resistors, signal generator, output meter,
DC power supply

**THEORY**:
An instrumentation amplifier (INA) is a very special type of differential input amplifier; its primary focus is to provide differential gain and high common-mode
rejection. INAs offer high input impedance and low output impedance; newer devices will also offer low offset and low noise. The unique combination of a high common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) and high accuracy make INAs especially attractive for applications with small error budgets such as motor controllers, battery test equipment, analog input modules, LCD test equipment and patient monitoring systems. The general definition of an INA is a circuit or device fitted with one to three
internal operational amplifiers (op amps) to improve signal quality and increasecommon-mode rejection. The more common type of INA is the three op-amp configuration
