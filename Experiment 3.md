 **DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFLIER** 

**THEORY**<br/>
 A differential amplifier is an electronic device designed to amplify the difference between two input signals, Whereas a normal amplifier,which amplifies a sinle input signal. The basic differential amplifier consists of Two Input Terminals,Amplification stage,Output.<br/>
 
 **IDEAL DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIER :** IN an ideal case,a differential amplifier would have infinite common-mode rejection,meaning it would prefectly reject any common-mode signals ans amplify only the difference between V1 and V2.<br/>

 **PRACTICAL DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIER:** In practice, real differential amplifiers are not prefect and will have a finite CMRR.This means that while they are excellent at rejection common-mode signals,they will still amplify a small portion of any common-mode signal.<br/>

**AIM** : Design and analyze the MOS Differential ampliflier circuit for the following specifications.

 **Objectives:**
 1. To understand the operation of differential amplifier.
 2. To obtain gain and to observe the moods of operation.

 **Procedure**<br/>

 Step 1 : DC Analysis:
 1. Fix the appropriate Q point 
 2. Increase Vicm to 1V and observe Vocm,Vp
 3. Calculate input swign and output swign
 4. Gain Equation using smallsignal modle

Step 2 : Transient Analysis:
1. Apply Vinp-pmax and verify the output, calculate gain if the output is linear

Step 3 : AC Analysis:
1. Find the 3-db BW

Replace the resistor in the circuit by Current source do the same procedure and again replace it by 
N Channel Mosfet
