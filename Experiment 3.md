 **DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFLIER** 

**THEORY**
 A differential amplifier is an electronic device designed to amplify the difference between two input signals, Whereas a normal amplifier,which amplifies a sinle input signal. The basic differential amplifier consists of Two Input Terminals,Amplification stage,Output.


**AIM** : Design and analyze the MOS Differential ampliflier circuit for the following specifications.
