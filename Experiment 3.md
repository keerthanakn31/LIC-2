 **DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFLIER** 

**THEORY**<br/>
 A differential amplifier is an electronic device designed to amplify the difference between two input signals, Whereas a normal amplifier,which amplifies a single input signal. The basic differential amplifier consists of Two Input Terminals,Amplification stage,Output.<br/>
 
 **IDEAL DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIER :** IN an ideal case,a differential amplifier would have infinite common-mode rejection,meaning it would prefectly reject any common-mode signals ans amplify only the difference between V1 and V2.<br/>
 
 **PRACTICAL DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIER:** In practice, real differential amplifiers are not prefect and will have a finite CMRR.This means that while they are excellent at rejection common-mode signals,they will still amplify a small portion of any common-mode signal.<br/>
 
**Key characteristics:**

- High Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR): The differential amplifier rejects common-mode signals, which are signals that are present on both input lines.

- High Differential Gain: The differential amplifier amplifies the difference between the two input signals.

- Low Noise: The differential amplifier has low noise, making it suitable for use in high-precision applications.

**AIM** : Design and analyze the MOS Differential ampliflier circuit.

 **Objectives:**
 1. To understand the operation of differential amplifier.
