# 555 Timer Monostable Multivibrator

### AIM
Generate a waveform with pulse width of 0.5 ms under different trigger conditions using 555 timer IC 

## THEORY
A monostable multivibrator is an electronic circuit that has one stable state and one temporary (unstable) state. When triggered by an external input, it temporarily switches to its unstable state for a specific period and then returns to the stable state. The 555 timer IC, when configured in monostable mode, performs this function effectively.

WORKING PRINCIPLE:
In the monostable configuration, the 555 timer output is initially LOW.
When a negative trigger pulse (voltage drops below 1/3 Vcc) is applied to the trigger pin (Pin 2), the output (Pin 3) goes HIGH.
It stays HIGH for a time determined by an external resistor (R) and capacitor (C).
Once this time has elapsed, the capacitor charges to 2/3 Vcc, and the output goes LOW again — returning to its stable state.
The output pulse duration (T) is given by the formula:

*T = 1.1 x R x C*

Where:
- R = Resistance in ohms
- C = Capacitance in farads
- T = pulse width (seconds)

Internally, the 555 timer has:
 Two voltage comparators
 An SR flip-flop
 A discharge transistor
 A voltage divider network (three 5kΩ resistors)

# KEY FEATURES
- Accurate pulse generation (0.5ms) on each trigger.
- Ignores further triggers during pulse duration (non-retriggerable).
- Triggered externally using digital signals or another 555 timer in astable mode.
- Can be used in digital timing, pulse generation, and signal shaping applications.

# CALCULATION

*T = 0.5 ms*

Using the monostable formula:

*T = 1.1 x R x C*

Assuming:
- C = 1 µF

Then:

*R = T/1.1 x C = 454.54 Ω

Selected values:
- R = 454.54 Ω
- C = 1 µF

These values yield a pulse duration of approximately 0.5 ms.

# SIMULATION ANALYSIS


# Transient Analysis:
Used to observe and confirm the timing characteristics of the output signal when different trigger inputs are applied.
# <ins>Procedure
Launch LTspice and create a new schematic file. Build the circuit according to the given circuit diagram.
Select appropriate component values for the resistor (R) and capacitor (C) based on the specified timing requirements.
Set up the transient simulation:
-Go to the Simulate menu and click on Edit Simulation Cmd.
-Choose the Transient analysis option and set the simulation time according to the expected pulse duration or analysis needs.

# CASE 1: Properly Spaced Triggers

-Trigger Pulse Source:
Use the following pulse definition for the trigger input:
VTrig PULSE(5 0 0.05m 0 0 0.01m 2m)
This creates a periodic falling edge every 2 milliseconds, providing enough time between triggers.

-Simulation Time:
Run the simulation for a total of 10 milliseconds to capture multiple trigger events.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa0898bb-c1df-4b4f-8704-0ff9bd493922)

-Expected Output Behavior:
 Each falling edge from the trigger pulse initiates the monostable timing cycle.
 The output voltage (VOUT) should go HIGH for approximately 0.5 milliseconds after each trigger.
 As a result, you should observe multiple distinct output pulses within the simulation window.
 
 # CASE 2: Rapid Repeated Triggers

-Trigger Pulse Source:
Define the trigger input as:
VTrig PULSE(5 0 0.05m 0 0 0.01m 0.2m)
This creates a falling edge every 0.2 milliseconds, which is faster than the output pulse duration.

-Simulation Duration:
Run the simulation for 2 milliseconds to observe the effect of rapid triggering.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/655dfb41-dfd8-4a42-9358-80fecba61d1f)

-Expected Output Behavior:
 The first falling edge successfully triggers the 555 timer.
 The output (VOUT) then goes HIGH for 0.5 milliseconds.
 Any additional triggers during this HIGH period are ignored because the timer is already active.

 # INFERENCE

In monostable configuration, the 555 timer successfully produces a precise 0.5 ms pulse in response to a trigger signal.

The circuit demonstrates non-retriggerable behavior, as it ignores subsequent triggers during the active output period.

A stable and consistent triggering mechanism is achieved by combining an astable signal source with edge-detection or filtering logic, ensuring accurate pulse generation.

# CONCLUSION

The 555 timer IC, when configured in monostable mode, effectively generates a fixed-duration output pulse in response to a valid trigger input. The circuit’s non-retriggerable nature ensures pulse integrity by preventing additional triggers during the active period. By integrating an astable signal source with edge-filtering logic, reliable and noise-free triggering is achieved. Overall, the experiment confirms the predictable and stable behavior of the 555 timer in timing and pulse generation applications.


# Astable Multivibrator And Monostable Multivibrator Using 555 Timer ICs

# AIM

Generate a waveform with pulse width of 0.5 ms under different trigger conditions using 555 timer IC.
# THEORY

An Astable Multivibrator is a circuit that coontinuously switches between two unstable states without requiring any external triggering. It operates as a self-oscillating square wave output, which is ideal for applications like clocks, pulse generation, and frequency synthesis.

In most implementations, the 555 timer IC is often used to create an astable multivibrator. In this mode, the 555 timer works by charging and discharging a capacitor through resistors, which results in the generation of a periodic square wave.

# WORKING PRINCIPLE OF THE ASTABLE MULTIVIBRATOR

1. Charging Phase:

The capacitor charges through R1 and R2.
When the capacitor voltage reaches 2/3 of Vcc, the internal comparator resets the flip-flop.
The output goes LOW.

2. Discharging Phase:

The capacitor discharges through R2 only (through pin 7).
When the voltage drops to 1/3 of Vcc, the comparator sets the flip-flop.
The output goes HIGH, and the cycle repeats.
This cycle of charging and discharging creates a continuous square wave.
Output Characteristics:

The frequency of the oscillation depends on R1, R2 and C:

Frequency = 1.44/(R1 + 2 x R2) X C

Duty Cycle = R1 + R2/R1 + 2 X R2

# CIRCUIT DESIGN AND CALCULATION
### <ins> Calculations
### Astable Multivibrator
*ton = 0.69 (R1 + R2)C2*,   *toff = 0.69 x R1 x C2*

#### <ins>Case 1:
Consider ton = 0.3 ms, toff = 0.2 ms and C2 = 0.01 µF

*R2 = 0.2 x 10^-3/0.69 x 0.01µ = 28.985k Ω*

*R1 = (0.3 x 10^-3/0.69 x 0.01µ) - 28.985k = 14.493k Ω*

#### <ins>Case 2:
Consider ton = 0.7 ms, toff = 0.3 ms and C2 = 0.01 µF

*R2 = 0.3 x 10^-3/0.69 x 0.01µ = 43.478k Ω*

*R1 = (0.7 x 10^-3/0.69 x 0.01µ) - 43.478k = 57.971k Ω*
#### <ins>Case 3:
Consider ton = 0.1 ms, toff = 0.4 ms and C2 = 0.01 µF
This is not possible as ton must be greater than toff in astable multivibrator. Thus consider ton = 0.4 ms and toff = 0.1 ms and invert the output

*R2 = 0.1 x 10^-3/0.69 x 0.01µ = 14.492k Ω*

*R1 = (0.4 x 10^-3/0.69 x 0.01µ) - 14.492k = 43.479k Ω*

### Differentiator Circuit
Let C4 = 0.1 µF, fa = 1k Hz and fb = 10k Hz

*fa = 1/2 x pi x R4 x C4*

*R4 = 1/2 x pi x 0.1µ x 10^3 = 1.59k Ω*

*fb = 1/2 x pi x R3 x C4*

*R3 = 1/2 x pi x 0.1µ x 10 x 10^3 = 159 Ω*
### Monostable Multivibrator
*T = 1.1 x R X C*

For pulse width,T= 0.5 ms and C = 1 µF

*R = 0.5/1.1 x 10^-6 = 454.54 Ω*

### 6. OUTPUT WAVEFORMS AND RESULTS
### <ins>Case 1: 
For ton = 0.3 ms and toff = 0.2 ms, Period = 0.5 ms
### <ins>Output Waveforms

### <ins>Output Waveforms

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c47ea2d-1a10-4e8d-b2a0-c95b9db8e722)

First waveform is the output of astable multivibrator, second waveform is the of differentiator circuit, third is the output of positive clipper circuit and lastly fourth waveform is the output of monostable multivibrator with pulse width of 0.5 ms.

**Output Result**:
 Pulse of 0.5 ms at every 1 ms.
  - The output is clean, periodic pulse:
    - **High** for 0.5 ms, then **LOW** for 0.5 ms.
  - Output duty cycle = 50%.

### <ins>Case 3: 
For ton = 0.4 ms and toff = 0.1 ms, Period = 0.5 ms. Then by using a transistor inverter, the final waveform that triggers the monostable will have 
- ton = 0.1 ms
- toff = 0.4 ms
This allows:
- Clear separation between trigger pulses.
- Enough time for the monostable to reset before the next pulse.

### <ins>Output Waveforms

**Output Result**:
  - Monostable is triggered at every 0.5 ms.
  - Monostable pulse width = 0.5 ms.
  - This results in continuous high output, as each new trigger occurs before previous monostable pulse finishes.
    
### 7. INFERENCE
- The Astable Multivibrator using a 555 timer successfully generated periodic square wave signals without requiring any external triggering.
- The **Differentiator** and **Clipper circuits** were effective in converting sqaure wave edges into narrow negative spikes, suitable for triggering monostable timer.
- The **Monostable Multivibrator** responds accurately to each valid trigger, producing consistent 0.5 ms output pulses/
- Simulation across multiple timing cases (Cases 1,2 and 3) confirms that the pulse width remains fixed at 0.5 ms, regardless of the input frequency or duty cycle.
- In **Case 3**, continuous triggering before previous pulse ends causes the monostable output to stay HIGH, demonstrating how the trigger frequency can affect pulse overlap.

### 8. CONCLUSION
The experiment demonstrates that a 555 timer can be configured in both Astable and Monostable modes to generate and shape precise timing pulse. The combination of logic elements-differentiator, clipper and inverter-ensures clean and reliable triggering of the monostable multivibrator. The system is robust, versatile and suitable for a wide range of timing applications, including waveform generation, delay circuits and digital pulse shaping.
